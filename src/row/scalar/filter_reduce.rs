//! Scalar reference for the separable **filter** resampler's H/V passes —
//! the signed twin of [`area_reduce`](super::area_reduce).
//!
//! Each output sample is a dot product of **signed** `f32` coefficients
//! over its source window. Unlike the integer area engine the sums are
//! not exact: every backend accumulates in `f64` and matches this
//! reference within a small tolerance — the integer streams end up `±1`
//! LSB of Pillow (the user-accepted contract), not bit-for-bit. The
//! H-pass leaves the **raw `f64` dot product** in `h_tmp`; the stream
//! quantizes it to PIL's two-pass intermediate per element type
//! afterwards (`quantize_intermediate`), so the H-pass itself only
//! differs per element by how a sample widens to `f64`.
//!
//! The coefficient window is the `FilterStream`'s `h.span(ox)` slice; the
//! SIMD arena pads each window to a lane multiple with zero coefficients
//! (zero annihilates), so the kernels run pure wide loads while still
//! summing exactly the real taps. The V-pass is element-wise over the
//! already-`f64` `h_tmp`, so it has a single form shared by every element.
