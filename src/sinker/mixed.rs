//!
//! High‑bit‑depth source impls expose both `with_rgb` (u8 output) and
//! `with_rgb_u16` (native‑depth u16 output). Calling `with_rgb_u16` on
//! an 8‑bit source format is a compile error.
//!
//! All configuration and processing methods are fallible — no panics
//! under normal contract violations — so the sink is usable on
//! `panic = "abort"` targets.
