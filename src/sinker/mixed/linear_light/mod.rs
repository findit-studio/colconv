//! RFC #238 Phase 2 — the [`AveragingDomain::Linear`] linear-light tail for
//! the planar 8-bit YUV family (`Yuv420p` / `Yuv422p` / `Yuv444p` /
//! `Yuv440p`).
//!
//! The encoded average bins the YUV codes (or the gamma-encoded RGB) and is
//! the default; the linear-light average instead mixes light. The convert
//! `YUV→RGB` is affine (a Q15 matrix + offset + clamp, no transfer), so the
//! two land at materially different RGB — the quality trade the Linear
//! domain offers. The pipeline is, per the RFC:
//!
//! ```text
//! YUV row  →[convert]→  encoded RGB  →[EOTF]→  linear RGB
//!          →[area bin (AreaStream<f32>)]→  linear RGB (out res)
//!          →[OETF]→  encoded RGB  →  RGB / RGBA
//! ```
//!
//! The decode is the format's own existing `YUV→RGB` row kernel (chroma
//! upsampled in-register), supplied by the caller as a closure so all four
//! formats share the linearise → bin → re-encode tail. The
//! [`TransferFunction`] is the sink's caller override, else the
//! per-[`ColorMatrix`] default.
//!
//! # What "linear" means here: display-referred vs scene-referred
//!
//! Which `YUV→RGB` decode fills the buffer the EOTF lifts is selected by the
//! sink's [`LinearMode`] (RFC #238 #244) — the only mode-dependent step:
//!
//! - [`LinearMode::DisplayReferred`] (the default) decodes through the
//!   production `yuv_*_to_rgb_row` family, whose Q15 convert **clamps and
//!   quantizes** the result to 8-bit `[0, 255]` BEFORE this tail sees it. So
//!   the average is taken over the *display-referred* converted 8-bit RGB
//!   lifted to linear light — a gamma-correct resize of the in-gamut RGB.
//!   Out-of-gamut YUV excursions (super-black / super-white, or chroma that
//!   drives a channel past the cube) are clipped at the convert, so values
//!   that would average back into gamut are lost. The clamped 8-bit RGB
//!   mapped to `[0, 1]` is never negative, so the odd-symmetric negative-side
//!   extrapolation of [`TransferFunction::eotf`] / [`oetf`] is dormant on this
//!   path.
//! - [`LinearMode::SceneReferred`] decodes the **same affine matrix** — the
//!   same `Coefficients` and `range_params_n::<8, 8>` the Q15 kernel uses —
//!   in unclamped real-valued `f32` (`yuv_*_to_rgb_f32_unclamped_row`),
//!   differing from the display decode ONLY by the absent intermediate Q15
//!   rounding and the absent final clamp+round. The out-of-gamut excursions
//!   are preserved (a channel may go `< 0` or `> 1`), lifted to linear light
//!   by the SAME EOTF — whose odd-symmetric extrapolation, retained in
//!   [`TransferFunction`] as public API for exactly this consumer, now
//!   activates — averaged in linear light, and clamped **only** at the
//!   re-encoded output. The two modes coincide (modulo `f32` rounding) on
//!   content that stays in gamut through the decode.
//!
//! [`LinearMode`]: crate::resample::LinearMode
//! [`LinearMode::DisplayReferred`]: crate::resample::LinearMode::DisplayReferred
//! [`LinearMode::SceneReferred`]: crate::resample::LinearMode::SceneReferred
//!
//! # Frame-buffered
//!
//! Like the validated PoC, the tail accumulates the linearised RGB for the
//! whole frame and bins once the last source row lands — the area bin is 2D
//! and the chroma upsample is per-row, so a frame buffer keeps the splice
//! self-contained without threading the row-stream bookkeeping the encoded
//! tiers carry. The frame buffer lives on the sink and resets per
//! `begin_frame`. Only `Yuv420p` / `Yuv422p` / `Yuv444p` / `Yuv440p` are
//! wired; every other format and the encoded domain are untouched.

  // decode (writes scratch only), and — on the final row — the whole bin tail's
  // allocations. On the FIRST output-bearing row the new frame is built into a
  // LOCAL (`new_frame`), NOT `*frame`, so a failure in this phase that precedes
  // the commit leaves `*frame` `None` (no `frozen_transfer`, no `next_y == 0`):
  // the call is fully retryable with a corrected transfer / matrix. The
  // bin-tail and decode read only plane DIMENSIONS (`w` / `h` / `plan`), never
  // persistent frame state, so they need no `*frame` borrow and run identically

  // the accumulator EXACTLY as it was on entry — `*frame` unchanged (`None` on
  // the first row, the prior buffer with its `next_y` unadvanced on later rows)
  // — so the same sink retries the row cleanly with no `begin_frame`.
