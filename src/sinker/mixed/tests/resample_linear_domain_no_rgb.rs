//! RFC #238 Phase 2 — the [`AveragingDomain::Linear`] silent-fallback guard
//! under `yuv-planar` WITHOUT `rgb`.
//!
//! `with_averaging_domain` is gated on `yuv-planar` alone, but the linear-light
//! tail decodes to RGB and so is only compiled under `rgb`. With `yuv-planar`
//! but not `rgb`, a `Linear` sink therefore cannot honour the domain — and it
//! must REJECT with a typed error, never silently fall through to the Encoded
//! path (which would resample in the wrong colour domain behind the caller's
//! back). This pins the always-compiled choke-point guard at each planar 8-bit
//! YUV dispatch site for the `rgb`-off build.
