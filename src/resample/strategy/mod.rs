//! RFC #238 staged-resampling-pipeline framework — Phase 0.
//!
//! The RFC models the convert→resample path as a *staged pipeline* and
//! treats a resample as a **splice** into that pipeline at a chosen
//! stage. The colour domain an area downscale averages in then falls out
//! of *where* the splice lands: averaging the native codes before the
//! convert is a different result from converting first and averaging the
//! output. This module is the production foundation those splice stages
//! and the domain choice are expressed through; the design was validated
//! end-to-end against one format by the held PoC (see the
//! `AveragingDomain` history note below).
//!
//! Phase 0 introduces the framework **types** plus an insertion-point
//! [`select_insertion_point`] **selector**, and re-expresses the existing
//! native-vs-row-stage dispatch of `Yuv420p` (4:2:0 planar) through that
//! selector with **zero behaviour change** — the selector reproduces
//! today's tier choice bit-for-bit. Only [`AveragingDomain::Encoded`] and
//! its two splice stages ([`InsertionPoint::NativeCodes`] /
//! [`InsertionPoint::EncodedOutput`]) are exercised; the [`Linear`] and
//! [`Premultiplied`] domains, the full per-plane filter spec, and the
//! support policy are later phases.
//!
//! [`Linear`]: AveragingDomain::Linear
//! [`Premultiplied`]: AveragingDomain::Premultiplied
